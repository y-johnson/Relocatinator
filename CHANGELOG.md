Polished different portions of the program to reflect better programming practices.

* Added a built-in `````trim()````` to the messages printed by ConsoleEvent.
* Started to reduce HandBrake reliance in an effort to decouple it from Relocatinator.

To-Do:

* Work towards fully removing the dependency on legacy HandBrake compatibility code to extend program utility and
  versatility.
    
* Refactor most of the program logic to make it more structured and clean.
* Add JavaDocs for all methods.
