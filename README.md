# Relocatinator

### Relocatinator is a personal project that aims to be a file organization tool.

The goal is to manipulate files based off easily retrieved information such as media name, resolution, etc.

### Current features
* Can parse information from file names such as resolution, episode number, season number and movie release year.
* After interpreting the information, it can rename or move files to a target destination in a normalized format.


### Relocatinator is in ***alpha***; what does that mean for you?

- This project is for educational purposes first and foremost.
	- The maintainer (me) is using this repository to learn more about Java libraries, Git, issue trackers, etc.
- This code is *not* guaranteed constant or regular updates.
- Nothing is guaranteed to work as new functionality and complexities get added.
